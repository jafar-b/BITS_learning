TASK:  
⿡ Create Context and Reducer for Task Management  
Use useContext to create a TaskContext for global state management.  
Use useReducer to handle actions like adding, deleting, and toggling tasks.  
Task Actions:  
ADD_TASK → Adds a new task  
REMOVE_TASK → Removes a task  
TOGGLE_TASK → Marks a task as completed/incomplete  
⿢ Use useMemo to Optimize Task Filtering  
Display total completed tasks using useMemo.  
Memoize calculations so they don’t re-run unnecessarily.  
⿣ Use useCallback to Optimize Event Handlers  
Optimize addTask and toggleTask functions using useCallback.  
Ensure that these functions don’t unnecessarily re-render child components.
